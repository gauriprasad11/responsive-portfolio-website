# My Developer Portfolio :)

### Building using HTML, CSS & Javascript!

Steps I follow :

1. Figure out a rough design of what I want to build.

2. Implement a framework in HTML.

3. Decide it's colors and other design features and implement those in CSS.

4. Code the backend in Javascript wherever required.

5. Redesign each part as per requirement!
